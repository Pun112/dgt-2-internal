        <p>I've been hitting the beaches along the east coast for a few months now, mostly surfing remote beaches, but close enough to to town to grab a feed and refuel.</p> 



        <p>The locals are super chill in the most part, and you shouldn't have any trouble finding a place to park. imo, you shouldn't have any trouble at all, as long as you follow <em>the rules!!!</em></p> 



        <h3>The Rules</h3> 



        <ol> 

          <li> <p>Drive the extra 5 minutes</p> 

            <p> If you think you're far enough out of town, you're not, drive/walk/camp an extra few minutes down the beach. Yeah, it's further to go, but it'll be so much less busy it'll be worth it.</p> 

          </li> 

          <li> <p>If you have to be in town - don't set up camp outside someone's house</p> 

            <p> This one's a bit of a no brainer, but it's worth saying. People generally don't mind if you stop for the night, or are super stealth, but they won't like it if it looks like you're setting up shop. Find somewhere more remote - or move on!</p> 

          </li> 

          <li> <p>Don't even <em>bother</em> trying to find overnight parking in Byron</p> 

            <p>Beautiful area, great people, and chockers right now! Save yourself (and the locals) some stress and camp half an hour down the road.</p> 

          </li>   

        </ol> 

         

        <p>Remember, if all else fails...</p> 






        <p>That's it for now, do something you enjoy.</p> 

         

        <p>Love,</p>
