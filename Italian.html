          <p>Italian mushroom risotto is a creamy, comforting dish with a rich, umami flavor from the mushrooms. Here’s a classic recipe for you:</p> 

          <h3>Italian Mushroom Risotto Recipe<h3>

          <p>Ingredients:
            1 cup Arborio rice (or other short-grain risotto rice)
            2 cups of mixed mushrooms (such as cremini, shiitake, and porcini), sliced
            1 small onion, finely chopped
            2 cloves garlic, minced
            1/2 cup dry white wine (optional, can substitute with more broth)
            4 cups chicken or vegetable broth (keep warm)
            2 tablespoons unsalted butter
            2 tablespoons olive oil
            1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
            Salt and black pepper to taste
            1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves or 1 teaspoon dried thyme
            1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)
            1/4 cup heavy cream (optional, for extra creaminess)</p> 

          <h3> Instructions:</h3> 

            <p>Prepare the Ingredients:
                Prepare the Broth:

In a saucepan, keep the chicken or vegetable broth warm over low heat. This helps the rice cook evenly and absorb the flavors.
Sauté the Mushrooms:

Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they are browned and tender, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the mushrooms from the skillet and set aside.
Cook the Aromatics:

In the same skillet, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter. Sauté the finely chopped onion until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another 1 minute.
Toast the Rice:

Add the Arborio rice to the skillet and cook, stirring constantly, until the rice is lightly toasted and coated with the oil and butter, about 2 minutes.
Deglaze with Wine:

Pour in the white wine (if using) and cook, stirring frequently, until the wine is mostly absorbed by the rice.
Add the Broth:

Begin adding the warm broth, one ladleful at a time, to the rice. Stir frequently and allow the rice to absorb the liquid before adding more. This process should take about 18-20 minutes. Continue adding broth and stirring until the rice is creamy and cooked al dente.
Combine Mushrooms and Season:

Once the rice is cooked, stir in the sautéed mushrooms. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well until the butter and cheese are melted and incorporated.
Finish and Serve:

If using, stir in the heavy cream for extra creaminess. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Garnish with fresh thyme leaves and parsley if desired. Serve hot.<p>
                <p>Enjoy your delicious, homemade mushroom risotto! It’s a perfect dish for a cozy dinner or special occasion.
