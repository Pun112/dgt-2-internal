          <p>Indian curry is wonderfully diverse, with countless regional variations. Here's a basic recipe for a classic, flavorful chicken curry to get you started</p> 

          <h3>Chicken Curry Recipe<h3>

          <p>Ingredients:
            
            For the Marinade:

              500 grams (about 1 pound) chicken (boneless, skinless, cut into pieces)
              1 cup plain yogurt
              1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
              1 teaspoon turmeric powder
              1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
              Salt to taste</p> 

          <p>For the Curry:

            2 tablespoons vegetable oil or ghee
            1 large onion, finely chopped
            2-3 green chilies, slit (adjust to taste)
            1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
            2 large tomatoes, finely chopped or blended
            1 teaspoon turmeric powder
            1 teaspoon cumin powder
            1 teaspoon coriander powder
            1 teaspoon garam masala
            1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
            Salt to taste
            1 cup water or chicken broth
            Fresh cilantro (coriander) leaves for garnish<p>

          <h3> Instructions:</h3> 

            <p>Marinate the Chicken:

              In a bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt.
              Add the chicken pieces and mix well to coat them.
              Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight for better flavor).
              Cook the Curry:
              
              Heat oil or ghee in a large pan over medium heat.
              Add the chopped onions and green chilies. Saut√© until the onions turn golden brown.
              Add the ginger-garlic paste and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the raw smell disappears.
              Add the chopped or blended tomatoes and cook until the oil starts to separate from the mixture.
              Stir in the turmeric, cumin, coriander powders, garam masala, red chili powder, and salt. Cook for a few minutes until the spices are well-blended.
              Add the marinated chicken pieces to the pan. Stir well to coat the chicken with the spice mixture.
              Pour in the water or chicken broth, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked and tender.
              Adjust the seasoning if needed. If the curry is too thick, you can add a little more water or broth to reach your desired consistency.
              Garnish and Serve:
              
              Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves.
              Serve hot with rice, naan, or roti.<p>
                <p>Feel free to adjust the spices to your taste or add vegetables if you like. Enjoy your curry!<p>
