          <p>Ingredients:

            1 tablespoon of vegetable oil
            1/2 pound of pork belly or pork shoulder, thinly sliced (can substitute with tofu for a vegetarian version)
            1 small onion, sliced
            2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
            1 tablespoon of ginger, minced (optional)
            1-2 tablespoons of gochujang (Korean red chili paste) or gochugaru (Korean red chili flakes), adjust to taste
            2 cups of beef or vegetable broth
            1 tablespoon of soy sauce (or to taste)
            1 teaspoon of sesame oil
            1 block of tofu, cut into cubes (optional)
            2 green onions, chopped
            1 tablespoon of sugar (optional, to balance flavors)
            1 cup of mushrooms (shiitake or button mushrooms), sliced (optional)
            1 small zucchini, sliced (optional)</p> 

          <h3> Instructions:</h3> 

            <p>Prepare the Ingredients:
                If using pork, slice it thinly. Cut the kimchi into bite-sized pieces. Slice the onion and mushrooms, and cube the tofu if using.
               
                Cook the Pork: 
                Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the sliced pork and cook until it's browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes.
               
                Add Aromatics:
                Add the sliced onion, garlic, and ginger (if using) to the pot. Saut√© until the onion is translucent and fragrant, about 3 minutes.
               
                Add Kimchi and Seasonings: 
                Stir in the kimchi and gochujang (or gochugaru). Cook for about 2 minutes to let the kimchi flavor infuse into the pork.
               
                Add Broth and Simmer:
                Pour in the beef or vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 10 minutes.
                
                Add Vegetables and Tofu:
                If using tofu, mushrooms, or zucchini, add them to the pot. Simmer for another 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the flavors are well combined.
                
                Season to Taste:
                Stir in the soy sauce and sesame oil. Taste and adjust seasoning with additional soy sauce or sugar if needed.
                
                Finish and Serve:
                Garnish with chopped green onions. Serve hot, ideally with a bowl of steamed rice and some banchan (Korean side dishes).<p>
