          <p>Japanese curry and chicken katsu is a delicious and comforting dish that’s popular in Japan. Here’s a simple recipe to make both components:</p> 

          <h3>Japanese Curry<h3>

          <p>Ingredients:
            
            1 lb (450g) potatoes, peeled and cubed
            1 large carrot, peeled and sliced
            1 onion, chopped
            2 tablespoons vegetable oil
            4 cups (1 liter) chicken or vegetable broth
            1 tablespoon soy sauce
            1 tablespoon sugar
            1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
            1-2 tablespoons curry powder (adjust to taste)
            1 package (8-10 oz) Japanese curry roux (available in mild, medium, or hot; e.g., Golden Curry or S&B)</p> 

 

          <h3> Instructions:</h3> 

              <p></p>
                Sauté Vegetables: Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent.
                Add Vegetables and Broth: Add the cubed potatoes and sliced carrots. Stir to combine. Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, soy sauce, sugar, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil.
                Simmer: Reduce the heat to low and let the vegetables simmer until tender, about 15-20 minutes.
                Add Curry Roux: Break the curry roux into pieces and add it to the pot. Stir until the roux is fully dissolved and the curry thickens. Simmer for an additional 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p> 
          <h3> Chicken Katsu:</h3> 

              <p> Ingredients:

                4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs
                Salt and pepper to taste
                1 cup all-purpose flour
                2 large eggs
                1 cup panko breadcrumbs (Japanese breadcrumbs)
                Vegetable oil for frying
                Instructions:
                
                Prepare Chicken: Place the chicken between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound to an even thickness using a meat mallet or rolling pin. Season with salt and pepper.
                Bread the Chicken:
                Set up a breading station with three shallow dishes: one with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with panko breadcrumbs.
                Dredge each piece of chicken in flour, shaking off the excess. Dip into the beaten eggs, then coat thoroughly with panko breadcrumbs, pressing down gently to adhere.
                Fry the Chicken: Heat a generous amount of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 4-5 minutes per side, depending on thickness. Ensure the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C). Remove and drain on paper towels.
                Slice and Serve: Slice the chicken katsu into strips</p>
