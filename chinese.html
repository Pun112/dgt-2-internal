          <p>Mapo Tofu is a classic Chinese dish known for its spicy, savory, and slightly numbing flavors.
             It originates from Sichuan cuisine and features soft tofu in a rich, spicy sauce with ground meat, typically pork or beef. Here’s a traditional recipe for Mapo Tofu:</p> 

          <h3>Mapo Tofu Recipe<h3>

          <p>Ingredients:
            1 block of firm tofu (14-16 oz), cut into bite-sized cubes
            1/2 pound ground pork or beef (can use chicken or tofu for a vegetarian version)
            2 tablespoons vegetable oil
            1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns (ground, or use pre-ground)
            2-3 tablespoons doubanjiang (Sichuan chili bean paste)
            1 tablespoon of minced garlic
            1 tablespoon of minced ginger
            2-3 tablespoons of soy sauce (adjust to taste)
            1 tablespoon of rice wine or dry sherry (optional)
            1 cup of chicken or vegetable broth
            1 teaspoon of cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons of water (for thickening)
            1-2 teaspoons of sugar (optional, to balance flavors)
            1-2 teaspoons of sugar (optional, to balance flavors)
            1-2 teaspoons of sugar (optional, to balance flavors)
            2 green onions, chopped
            1-2 teaspoons of sugar (optional, to balance flavors)
            1 tablespoon of sesame oil
            1-2 teaspoons of sugar (optional, to balance flavors)
            Red chili flakes or chili oil (optional, for extra heat)</p> 

          <h3> Instructions:</h3> 

            <p>Prepare the Ingredients:
                Prepare the Tofu:

                Place the tofu cubes in a pot of boiling water and simmer for 5 minutes to firm them up and remove excess moisture. Drain and set aside.
                Cook the Meat:
                
                Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the ground meat and cook until browned and cooked through, breaking it up into small pieces as it cooks.
                Add Aromatics and Spice:
                
                Add the minced garlic, ginger, and ground Sichuan peppercorns to the meat. Stir-fry for about 1 minute until fragrant.
                Stir in the doubanjiang (Sichuan chili bean paste) and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the paste is well incorporated and slightly caramelized.
                Add Liquids:
                
                Pour in the soy sauce, rice wine (if using), and chicken or vegetable broth. Stir well to combine.
                Simmer and Add Tofu:
                
                Bring the mixture to a simmer and gently add the tofu cubes. Let it cook for 5-7 minutes, allowing the tofu to absorb the flavors of the sauce.
                Thicken the Sauce:
                
                Stir in the cornstarch mixture (cornstarch and water) to thicken the sauce. Continue to simmer for a few more minutes until the sauce has thickened to your liking.
                Adjust Seasoning:
                
                Taste and adjust the seasoning with soy sauce, sugar, or more chili flakes if needed. If you prefer extra heat, you can add red chili flakes or chili oil at this stage.
                Finish and Serve:
                
                Drizzle with sesame oil and garnish with chopped green onions. Serve hot over steamed rice.<p>
                <p>Enjoy your Mapo Tofu! It’s a flavorful dish that pairs wonderfully with steamed rice and is sure to impress anyone who loves spicy, savory food.
